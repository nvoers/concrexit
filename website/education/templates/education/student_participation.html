                    The Program Committee (PC) is responsible for
                    giving advice concerning education and exam regulations,
                    that have to be approved every year, and evaluate the
                    quality of education. The PC consists of six students and
                    six teachers.
                    The PC considers both course evaluations and teacher's
                    reactions to those, and evaluates the quality of the
                    courses. They also give advice, even unsolicited, to the
                    Director of Education and dean.

                    The PC meets every month and works with, but independently
                    from the Board of Directors. Together, students and
                    teachers think about education in order to improve its
                    quality for everyone. The PC has their own page at
                    Radboudnet. You can also read more about the students that

                    The Faculty of Science has their own student participation
                    organ that concerns itself with matters that are important
                    to our faculty. This ranges from an expension of the
                    computer rooms to more lenient opening hours to changes
                    concerning education. The Faculty Student Council is open
                    for all suggestions that have anything to do with our
                    faculty. Whether you think there is not enough space in the
                    bicycle parking lots or that you did not get enough time on
                    your exams due to the procters, the Faculty Student Council
                    tries to tackle all problems and make sure that the Faculty
                    of Science remains the best faculty at our university.

                    The University Student Council (USC) is concerned with all
                    issues that concern the entire university. One could think
                    of the opening hours of the university library or the
                    renting of rooms for student organizations. The USC
                    consists of fourteen members. Eight are chosen by students
                    and the other six represent different student organizations
                    from the university. You can read more about the USC
